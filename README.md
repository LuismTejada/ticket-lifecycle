As an agent, you will be able to see live tickets in the agent panel. Queue managers will assign priority tickets to the appropriate agents as well as assign proper SLAs.

In this case, we are setting the priority level of the ticket. The priority has been set to Emergency since we are dealing with an issue that can affect an entire portion of the business. We assign it to an agent and changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top-level technician and set the department to System Administrators. In some ticketing systems, customers can set their own SLA plans.

The next step is to open the ticket and resolve it.
